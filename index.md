## Research \ Interests

I am a student in my final year at Brock University, finishing a Bachelors of Science
with a major in Physics and a minor in Mathematics. I am passionate about theories of gravity and
causality within general relativity and quantum mechanics. I would like to use the skills and
knowledge from this degree to push myself to explore these topics further, with a focus on theories
of quantum gravity.
