## Research \ Interests

I am a Master's student at the University of Western Ontario, studying physics with a scientific computing specialization. I have writen a Python package for general relativity, OGRePy, and a research project on wormhole time machines and multiple histories. I am passionate about cryptography and cyber security, data science, high performance computing, and software development. I am currently looking for a co-op position in 2023.
