## Research \ Interests

I am a student in my final year at Brock University. I am finishing a Bachelors of Science degree with a
major in Physics and a minor in Mathematics. I am passionate about theories of gravity and causality
within general relativity and quantum mechanics. I would like to use the skills and knowledge from this degree
to push myself to explore these topics further, with a focus on theories of quantum gravity.
