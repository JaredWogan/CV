## Research \ Interests

I am a student in my final year at Brock University, currently finishing a Bachelor's of Science degree,
majoring in Physics, with a minor in Mathematics. I am passionate about theories of gravity and causality
within the theory of general relativity, and would like to use the knowledge and skills learned while
completing this degree to explore these interests further. In particular, I am interested in exploring
theories of quantum gravity as well as causality.
